You get the royalty free right to:
    * Use the mod assets for any purpose;
    * Make derivative works of it (this is called a "Derived Work");
    * Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work.

If you distribute the mod assets or a Derived Work, you must give back to the 
community by:
    * Prominently noting the date of any changes you make;
    * Leaving this license terms in place;
    * Providing these mod assets in a form that is easy to get and best to modify;
    * Licensing it to everyone under ModEPL;
    * Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that license.

There are some things that you must shoulder:
    * You get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind;
    * If the mod assets damages you in any way, you may only recover direct 
    damages up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero if you did not pay 
    anything). You may not recover any other damages, including those called 
    "consequential damages." (The state or country where you live may not allow 
    you to limit your liability in this way, so this may not apply to you);

The ModEPL continues perpetually, except that your license rights end automatically 
if:
    * You do not abide by the "give back to the community" terms (your licensees 
    get to keep their rights if they abide);
    * Anyone prevents you from distributing the mod assets under the terms of the 
    ModEPL.
