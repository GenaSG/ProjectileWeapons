// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// There are two teams: Attackers and Defenders. 
//
// Attackers: A player in the attacking team will be switched to VIP once the 
// pre-match period ends. The attacking team needs to protect the VIP from being
// killed and escort him to the extraction zone marked as a blue square in the 
// game. Attackers can only win the round by extracting the VIP or eliminating 
// all the defenders.
// 
// Defenders: They need to prevent the VIP from reaching the extraction zone. They
// can accomplish this by defending the extraction zone or by just killing the VIP.
// Defending team can only win the round by killing the VIP or by holding the VIP
// from reaching the extraction zone in the allocated time.
//
// This is an elimination gametype so there's not respawn and a team will also
// win the round if it successfully eliminates the other team.
