// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Capture the Flag players on both teams need to steal the other team's flag
// and return to their base. Each team will also need to protect their flag from
// being taken as they won't be able to score a point if they return the enemy's
// flag to their base and their own flag is missing.
// 
// There are 3 modes for this gametype. In mode 0 the players will be able to 
// return their flag when the enemy drops it by touching it. In mode 1, the flag
// will remain on the location where it was dropped and it will be returned
// automatically after certain amount of time if no enemy player captures it 
// again. In mode 2, the players will have to recover the flag and return it 
// themselves to their own base.
