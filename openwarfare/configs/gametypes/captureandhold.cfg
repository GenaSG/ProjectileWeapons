// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// Players on both teams need to capture the flag that spawns in the middle of
// map and hold it to score points.
//
// There are two modes for this gametype. In mode 0, players will score one point
// after successfully holding the flag for certain amount of time. Once the team
// scores the point the round will end. In mode 1, the players will start scoring
// point for each 5 seconds they successfully hold the flag in their hands. In this
// mode the round will end by time limit or until the final score is reached.

//******************************************************************************
// CAPTURE AND HOLD SETTINGS
// ALL VARIABLES WORK IN RANKED AND UNRANKED MODES

// PLEASE REMEMBER TO UNCOMMENT THE LINES BY REMOVING THE DOUBLE SLASHES (//)
// WHEN CHANGING A VALUE. PLEASE DO NOT UNCOMMENT LINES SET TO DEFAULT VALUES.
