// GAMETYPE DESCRIPTION
//******************************************************************************
// In Retrieval there are two teams. Attackers (need to retrieve two objects and
// take them back to their spawn) and defenders (need to prevent the other team
// from retrieving the two objects).
//
// It is a team mode similar to classic capture the flag modes except the objects 
// must be retrieved within a round meaning players who die are out of the game 
// until the following round. If all the members of either team are eliminated 
// or the objects are retrieved then the round also ends with the winning team 
// receiving a point. The mode is generally played with numerous rounds on each 
// map and the team with the specified amount of wins according to the server 
// wins the match.
